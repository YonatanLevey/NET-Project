# NET-Project
My high-school project in .NET programming.

The project you have access to in this repository is the latest version of my CompSci project, which I have been building through the past 3 years (grades 10-12). You may download the full project, and make use of it as you wish. If you are interested in reading about the project, this repository also contains the portfolio for my project, although it is written in Hebrew. If you would like to read the portfolio but do not speak Hebrew, please notify me and I will attempt to make a copy in English, according to demand.

Thank you for reading,
from Yonatan Levey

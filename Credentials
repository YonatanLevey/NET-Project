In order to allow you to explore the website through all users of different permission levels, I have created new users, each with a different permission level, for your usage.

The permission levels are as follows:
Guest (No Level) - This is a user who has not logged in to the website, and therefore has no permissions beyond a few basic functions and registration.
Basic User (Level 0) - This is the lowest permission level, which is assigned to every user upon registration. This user may make use of all functions of the website, except for coaching (the ability to manage climbing groups and meetings), supply management, and user management.
Coach (Level 1)- This user can use all the functions of the website which a basic user can, and in addition to that manage his own climbing groups and their meetings.
Supply Manager (Level 2) - This user can use all the functions of the website which a coach can, and also manage the the website's shop (view sales statistics, add/remove items and item sizes, modify existing items, and modify the supply table).
General Manager (Level 3) - This user is able to do everything which the previous users can, and on top of that is in charge of managing all users and groups which exist in the website (and the group's corresponding meetings).

Credentials:
The following list contains credentials for users of all permission in the website. I have set sample information for them in all fields, but if you wish to modify this information you can do so in the "Info Editing Page" of the website.
